# S2 Cities Project

S2cities Bandung is a city with a high population growth rate, reaching 2,503,710 in 2018 and an average annual growth rate of 1.01%. The main objective of the Safe and Sound (S2) City project is to champion empowered Bandung youth who proactively contribute to the design of urban space safety policy-making, rebuild post-Covid community resilience, and actively participate in the implementation of low-carbon mechanisms to realize Bandung as a safe, low emission and innovative city. In implementing this project, the survey and mapping of youth in the city of Bandung were then compiled and visualized in the form of a WebGIS. The WebGIS developed aims to display spatial data related to the safety and comfort of the city of Bandung that can be accessed by the public.
